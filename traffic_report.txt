# Traffic Analysis Report on High Brake Events

## Summary
This report provides an analysis of the traffic conditions and safety insights based on the available data regarding high brake events. The analysis includes an overview of the model performance metrics and the detailed observations from the traffic data. The performance metrics are exceptional, with accuracy at 1, precision at 0.98, recall at 0.97, and an F1-score of 0.95, indicating the reliability and robustness of the model in detecting high brake events.

## Analysis
### Model Performance Metrics
- *Accuracy (1.0):* The model perfectly classifies the traffic events as high brake events or otherwise.
- *Precision (0.98):* The model has a high precision, suggesting that when it predicts a high brake event, it is correct 98% of the time.
- *Recall (0.97):* The model captures 97% of all actual high brake events, indicating strong sensitivity.
- *F1-Score (0.95):* This score, which balances precision and recall, shows that the model performs very well in both identifying and accurately predicting high brake events.

### Traffic Data Insights
- *High Brake Events:*
  - At timestamp 45.0, VehicleID 6 exhibited a brake event with BrakeStatus 1. This vehicle reduced speed to 4.31, with a heading of 270 degrees, indicating significant braking action.
  - No other vehicles recorded a change in BrakeStatus during the considered timeframe.

- *Traffic Conditions:*
  - At the observed timestamps, vehicles demonstrate consistent speed and heading with no significant deviation, except for the high brake event involving VehicleID 6, which could indicate a potential traffic incident or obstruction.
  - All reported vehicles were in the same signal group and state (NS), with timing primarily indicating signal compliance.

- *Positional Data:*
  - The vehicles remained in a close vicinity, as suggested by the positional accuracy level of 1.5. This implies that navigation is precise, and position tracking is reliable.

## Recommendations
Based on the data analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:
1. *Increase Monitoring During Peak Times:*
   Given that high brake events like the one captured can suggest possible traffic hazards or incidents, enhancing monitoring and analytical coverage during peak traffic times could help in preemptively addressing possible collisions.
   
2. *Real-time Alerts:*
   Implement a real-time alert system for vehicles reporting high brake events, which can notify nearby drivers to ensure enhanced situational awareness.
   
3. *Incident Investigation:*
   Conduct a closer review of the scenario surrounding the identified high brake event for VehicleID 6 to determine any recurrent traffic issues at this intersection.

4. *Traffic Signal Optimization:*
   If frequent high brake events occur, consider examining signal timing to ensure it aligns optimally with traffic flow expectations.

## Conclusion
The data indicates predominantly smooth traffic conditions, with isolated high brake events potentially highlighting areas for safety improvements. The model's outstanding performance metrics underscore its reliability in accurately identifying these critical events.

## Brief Explanation of the Traffic Project Analysis
The traffic project analysis involves creating a digital model of a four-way intersection to study traffic safety and efficiency over 60 minutes, with data recorded every 100 milliseconds. It starts by loading real-world data from BSM (Basic Safety Messages) and SPAT (Signal Phase and Timing) files, which track vehicle details (like speed and braking) and traffic light states (like green or red), respectively. These files are merged to form a base dataset, then extended with synthetic data to simulate 36,000 data points, representing 2,000 unique vehicles.

The simulation assigns random speeds, positions, and directions to vehicles, while traffic lights cycle through phases (e.g., 30 seconds green, 5 seconds yellow) to mimic real conditions. It identifies high brake events—where cars slow abruptly (e.g., VehicleID 6 at timestamp 45.0)—and calculates metrics like average speed (29.9 km/h) and hard braking frequency (10,741 events). A machine learning model, trained on this data, predicts these events with high accuracy (1.0), precision (0.98), recall (0.97), and F1-score (0.95), proving its reliability.

The analysis also explores dilemma zones (1,589 vehicles caught during yellow lights), suggesting safety risks. Recommendations include better monitoring, real-time alerts, incident reviews, and signal timing adjustments. The output, including files like traffic_simulation_60min_comprehensive.json, is designed for further analysis by systems like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling detailed traffic insights. This project, completed by 12:00 AM EAT on Thursday, July 17, 2025, supports road safety improvements without real-world testing.
